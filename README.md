🧟‍♂️ Zombie Arena Project Summary 🧟‍♀️

Embarked on an exhilarating game development odyssey with Zombie Arena, a project that not only brought undead hordes to life but also deepened my mastery of C++ fundamentals. Here's a snapshot of the epic journey:

🛠️ Class Mastery: Crafted the Player class, a cornerstone for our zombie-slaying adventure. Leveraged Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to enhance code organization and efficiency.

👁️‍🗨️ Dynamic Views: Explored the powerful SFML View class, unlocking the ability to navigate a scrolling world seamlessly while elevating the gaming experience.

🧑‍💻 Pointer Power: Unveiled the might of pointers, transforming variables into memory addresses and enabling the creation of a formidable zombie horde. Delved into the Standard Template Library (STL) and harnessed the map class for streamlined texture management.

🎨 Visual Depth: Mastered the art of sprite sheets to optimize rendering and boost frame rates. Implemented vertex arrays for dynamic background visuals, enhancing the atmospheric feel of the game.

🔧 Interactivity: Implemented collision detection, bringing bullets, pickups, and zombies into harmonious interaction. Enhanced gameplay with strategic choices and immersive challenges.

📊 HUD Magic: Incorporated a Heads-Up Display (HUD) to keep players informed about crucial details like score, high score, health, and ammunition. A visual feast that adds depth to the gaming experience.

🚀 Project Completion: Successfully wrapped up Zombie Arena, a culmination of learned C++ fundamentals, references, pointers, and sophisticated OOP techniques. Optimized game assets using a singleton class, paving the way for the next coding adventure.

🌐 Next Chapter: With a solid foundation, ready to extend these insights to efficiently manage all game assets in the upcoming project. The coding journey continues! 💻🎮
